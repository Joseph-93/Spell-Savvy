## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How long does it take for changes to apply?**
A: **Instantly!** Both individual and default bucket changes apply immediately. The student's next word request will use the new difficulty.

**Q: If I change the default, does it affect students with custom settings?**
A: **No!** Only students using the default (no custom override) are affected. Students with custom settings keep their custom difficulty.

**Q: How do I know how many students will be affected by changing the default?**
A: The Game Configuration page shows "Currently X student(s) are using this default setting" - that's how many will change immediately.

**Q: Will changing difficulty erase their progress?**
A: No! All their stats, history, and word performance are preserved. They just start getting different words.

**Q: Can I change a student's difficulty while they're playing?**
A: Yes! The change applies immediately. Their current session ends and the next word will be at the new difficulty.

**Q: What if I want to change everyone's difficulty, even those with custom settings?**
A: You'll need to visit each student's detail page and update them individually. The default only affects students without custom overrides.

**Q: What if I set the wrong difficulty?**
A: Just change it again! You can adjust as many times as needed, both for individuals and the default.

**Q: Can students see all difficulty levels?**
A: Students only see words from their current bucket. You control which bucket they're on.

**Q: Do I need to tell students when I change their difficulty?**
A: The system doesn't notify them, but they'll notice when they get their next word. Consider messaging them!
