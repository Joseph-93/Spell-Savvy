## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Naming Classrooms
**Good names:**
- "Period 1", "Period 2", etc.
- "Monday 9am", "Tuesday 2pm"
- "Advanced Spelling", "Beginner Spelling"
- "Class A", "Class B"

**Less helpful:**
- "My Class" (if you have multiple)
- "Students" (too generic)

### Multiple Periods?
Create separate classrooms for each:
- Period 1
- Period 2
- Period 3
- etc.

Each gets its own join code!

### Reusing Next Year?
Two options:

**Option 1: Delete old, create new**
- Delete last year's classroom
- Create "Class of 2026"
- Get fresh join code

**Option 2: Keep for records**
- Create new classroom
- Leave old one (students remain for reference)

### Security
- Don't post join links publicly online
- Regenerate codes if needed
- Delete inactive classrooms

## 🎯 Real-World Example

**Ms. Johnson, High School Teacher**

**Setup (5 minutes):**
1. Created 5 classrooms: "Period 1" through "Period 5"
2. Posted join links in each Google Classroom

**Result:**
- 150 students registered across 5 periods
- All automatically sorted into correct periods
- Easy to track progress by period
- Can share different word lists per period (future feature)

**Her favorite feature:**
"I love that I can just post a link and students are automatically in the right period. No more manually sorting through 150 students!"
